Version 0.0.5 (Thu Aug  4 11:09:08 EDT 2011)
--------------------------------------------
* JS: fixed ext parameter in createParameters(), so the '.' is needs to be supplied by user. 

Version 0.0.7 (Wed Aug  24 20:09:08 EDT 2011)
--------------------------------------------
* JRV: added a wrapper function to calculate dissimilarities on a point basis.
* JRV: fixed and updated documentation. No more roxygenize, pls

Version 0.0.8 (Thu Aug  25 22:09:08 EDT 2011)
--------------------------------------------
* JRV: changed summariseRuns() documentation.

Version 0.0.9 (Fri Aug  26 11:50:08 EDT 2011)
--------------------------------------------
* JRV: there was an important bug in the code in the way growing seasons were lagged. Growing season of reference point should keep constant, and it is the target point one that is rotated to match the reference.
* JRV: there were important differences between the results with the previous and this version (about 10-20% in values for temperature, but of 100% in some areas for rainfall).

Version 0.0.10 (Sat Aug  27 13:08:00 EDT 2011)
--------------------------------------------
* JRV: Bug fix. There was an error in how the operations were done when across.year=F. Hopefully fixed now.
* JRV: Bug fix. Report was failing in the conversion of a raster to a SpatialPointsDataFrame. Fixed.

Version 0.0.11 (Sun Aug  28 21:19:00 EDT 2011)
--------------------------------------------
* JRV: Bug fix. Small error in generating the roll for point analyses dissimilarityPoints() when the growing season was shorter than 12 months and the params$across.year=F
* JRV: Error in documentation fixed (report.Rd), m.lab appeared twice, not it was changed by r.lab and m.lab, respectively.

Version 0.0.12 (Mon Aug  29 17:31:00 EDT 2011)
--------------------------------------------
* JRV: Added user-input error verification in some functions, namely createParameters(), dissimilarity(), loadDataPoints(), loadWeightsPoints(), ccafsMPoints(), applyThreshold().
* JRV: Fixed errors documentation: report.Rd and createParameters.Rd
