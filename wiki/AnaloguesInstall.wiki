== 1. Where to get the latest version of the analogues R-package? ==

The analogue package exists as an online Google code project, at
http://code.google.com/p/ccafs-analogues/

The latest version can be downloaded at
http://code.google.com/p/ccafs-analogues/downloads/list

There you will see a list of files available for download (Figure 1). We are interested in the latest version of the library (in this case 0.0.11) for whichever Operating System (i.e. Linux, Windows) you have (both versions are circled red in Fig. 1).

== 2. How to download it? ==

Clicking on the corresponding file of Figure 1 will guide you to a new webpage (Figure 2), in which you will be able to see the name of the file and a brief description. It is important that you read the description, as this would inform you on the major modifications and/or improvements done to the package.

_*Figure 2* Downloading the latest version of the package_

Clicking on the link to the file would lead prompt a message asking you where to save this file (though this depends on the configuration of your browser) (Figure 3). You will select on “Save File”, and then click on “OK”.

_*Figure 3* Saving the package file_

A new window will prompt, asking you the specific location where to put this file. You will go to “C:/” and will create a folder named “analogues” (Figure 4A), inside which you will create another folder called “package” (Figure 4B). There you will store this file by clicking on “Save” (Figure 4C).

_*Figure 4* Creating analogues folder and saving the package file_

In this particular case, we have provided you with the latest package update in a CD-ROM. You can copy and paste it into the analogues folder.

== 3. How to install it onto your computer? ==

To do this, you will need to open the R interface, either from the Desktop shortcut or by clicking Start > All Programs > R > R 2.13.1 (or whichever version you might have). This will take you to the R Graphical User Interface (Gui) and the respective R Console (Figure 5), you now need to click on the “Packages” menu in the menu toolbar and then click on “Install package(s) from local zip files…” (Highlighted in blue in Figure 5).

_*Figure 5* The R Gui and console, and the Packages menu_

A new window will prompt and you will be able to search for files. Go to the location where you stored the analogues package as downloaded from internet or copied from the CD and click on "Open". This will install the package as a library in your current R installation folder. Now you can load the package.

== 4. How to load the package in R? ==

Once you have installed the package, you can load the library ‘analogues’ by typing in the R console:

{{{
library(analogues)
}}}

This will take less than a second to load, and you won’t notice any difference. You will know the loading did not fail, as you will not get any error message.

== 5. How to browse the package’s help? ==

If you want to browse the package’s available help you can type in the R console:

{{{
help(package="analogues")
}}}

This will open a small window showing you the main characteristics of the package (Figure 6), including the maintainer(s), the authors, version, and date released, and also an index of all the functions and methods within the package.

_*Figure 6* Help of the analogue package_

If you want to see more specific help (i.e. on a particular function) you need to type in the R console:

{{{
help(topic)
}}}

Where `topic` can be any of the functions or objects that are documented in the package help files. For instance, if you want to see the documentation of the function `createParameters()`, then you type:

{{{
help(createParamters)
}}}

This would open a new tab or window in your default browser with that function’s documentation.

== 6. How to download the accompanying climate data? ==

To get the accompanying climate data of this R-package you need to go again to the downloads section of the Google code repository (Figure 1):
http://code.google.com/p/ccafs-analogues/downloads/list

In that list, you need to search for the “Sample climate data (updated)”, the file is named “current_a1b_2030.zip”. Following the same procedure as in 2 you will download this file and store it into your ‘analogues’ folder, inside a folder named ‘climate-data’. After downloading the file, you will decompress it using any unzipping software. We suggest 7-zip (freely available at http://www.7-zip.org/), or just unzip them with the default Windows unzipping explorer-based tool.

Else, you can grab these data from the CD we provided, copy it to the required folder (i.e. C:/analogues/climate-data) and unzip it.

== 7. What are the accompanying sample climate data? ==

After you unzip these files you will see that many different files will appear on your climate-data folder. These are geographically referenced gridded datasets, in a format called ESRI-ASCII, in a Geographic Coordinate System with datum WGS-1984.

Each of the gridded files contains data for the whole globe land areas (from 180ºW to 180ºE in longitude and from 60ºS to 90ºN in latitude), every 50 kilometers (0.5 degree) and can be read into R using the ‘raster’ package. These can be simply referred to as ‘grids’ or ‘rasters’. 

There are two types of climate data in our set of files: present-day (referred to as “current” hereafter) and future climates (combination of 1 SRES emissions scenario, one period, and 24 different Global Climate Models). Current climate data are named as:

  _*current_{variable name}_[time step].asc*_

Where ‘variable name’ can be either tmean (for mean temperature), prec (for rainfall), and bio_1 to bio_19 for the 19 bioclimatic indices we calculated from monthly data (Table 1). For tmean and prec there are 12 time steps (corresponding to the 12 months of the year), and for each of the 19 bioclimatic indices, there is only one time step, as they represent seasonal trends or yearly averages of temperatures or rainfall.

_*Table 1* List of bioclimatic indices_
http://ccafs-analogues.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/img/tab1-3.1.PNG

Future climate data are named as:

	{SRES}_{period}_[GCM]_{variable name}_{time step}.asc

In this case the SRES emissions scenario is A1B (a1b), the period is 2030s (average of the 30 year period between 2020 and 2049, that is, 2020_2049), the 24 different GCMs are listed in Table 2, the variables are the same as for the current climate.
