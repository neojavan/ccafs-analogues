== Understanding the basics of the analogue R-library: the `createParameters()` function and functions for loading data and weights  ==

In this tutorial you will learn:
 # what are the different parameters and data required for an analogue run,
 # how to set up a given run,
 # how to load data once a run is configured,
 # how to load weights once a run is configured

What do you need to complete this tutorial?
 # Either a Windows or Linux operating system,
 # the latest version of R installed on your computer,
 # to have completed tutorial 3.1 successfully,
 # to understand the concept of analogues and the underlying principles and equations,


== 1. What are the required parameters and data for an analogue run? ==

In our analogue library there are a number of parameters (i.e. variables) that need to be specified in order to be able to perform a given analogue run. There are a total of 19 different parameters that can be specified in our tool. So it is worth spending some time going through each of them.

But before we get into the parameters, we need to know how these parameters are stored in R. To store the parameters we have created a function named `createParameters()`, in which the 19 different parameters can be specified. Once the 19 (sometimes less) parameters are specified, these are stored (by the function) as an object of type `list` in the RAM memory of your computer. 

The different parameters of the analogues tool to be specified when calling the function `createParameters()` are:

*{{{x}}}*: Longitude or coordinate X of the reference site when performing grid-based calculations, or a vector of length equal to the number of sites containing the longitudes or coordinates X of the sites being analyzed when performing point-based analyses. These must be in the same coordinate system of y and in the same coordinate system in which the raster data are.

*{{{y}}}*: Longitude or coordinate Y of the reference site when performing grid-based calculations, or a vector of length equal to the number of sites containing the longitudes or coordinates Y of the sites being analyzed when performing point-based analyses. These must be in the same coordinate system of x and in the same coordinate system in which the raster data are.
